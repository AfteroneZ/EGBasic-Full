# EGBasic-Full
EGBASIC Is like basic but its simple, based on python, free, open source, MIT Licensed, and after the 3rd version will be released a community edition, published by me, made by the community(EGBasic CE), and also after the 3rd version, work on EGBasic will be stopped and we will make another one (Hint : it starts with a V and ends with script), Enjoy!
